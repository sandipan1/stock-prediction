# stock-prediction
LSTM neural network to predict the closing price of the S&P 500 using a dataset of past prices.
LSTM has memory cells.Each cell has input gate, output gate and internal state that feeds into itself across timesteps with weight 1 . This eliminates vanishing gradient problem of RNN
## Dependencies :
 Tensorflow
 Keras
